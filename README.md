# Individual Code Lab

A simple Python project that runs two essays and checks for plagiarism between them.

---

This project includes:

- Two essay text files (`essay1.txt`, `essay2.txt`)  
- A Python script (`plagiarism.py`) that compares the essays and generates a similarity report  
- A report file (`reports/similarity_report.txt`) to show the result  
- Setup-related files (`setup.sh`, `setup.log`)

Why it exists;
It’s a lightweight plagiarism checker — useful for educational purposes, assignments, or just to understand how basic text comparison works.
